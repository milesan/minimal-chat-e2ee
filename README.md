# Minimal Chat

A minimalist, brutalist chat application with end-to-end encryption support. Built as a lightweight alternative to Slack with a focus on simplicity and security.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging** with WebSocket connections
- **End-to-end encryption** using Web Crypto API (AES-GCM)
- **Workspaces and channels** for organized communication
- **Direct messages** between users
- **Threaded conversations** for focused discussions
- **Quote/reply functionality** for contextual responses
- **Link aggregation** with voting system
- **Image sharing** (workspace setting)
- **Voice calls** using WebRTC
- **Three themes**: light, dark, and brutalist
- **Inbox view** for tracking mentions and replies
- **World view** for discovering content across channels

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimal-chat.git
cd minimal-chat
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
PORT=3035
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3033
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Frontend at http://localhost:3033
- Backend at http://localhost:3035

## Usage

1. **Create an account**: Sign up with a username and password
2. **Create a workspace**: Set up your first workspace
3. **Create channels**: Add channels for different topics
4. **Invite team members**: Share the workspace with others
5. **Enable encryption**: Create encrypted channels for sensitive discussions

### Encrypted Channels

To create an encrypted channel:
1. Click the `+` button next to "Channels"
2. Enter a channel name
3. Check "ðŸ”’ enable end-to-end encryption"
4. Choose a strong password (or use the suggested one)
5. Share the password securely with channel members

## Security

- Passwords are never sent to the server
- All encryption/decryption happens client-side
- Uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key derivation
- AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Each message has a unique salt and IV
